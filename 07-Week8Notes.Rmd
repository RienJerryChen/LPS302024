# Predicate Logic Practice Problems

## Part A

Using the following symbolization key:

- $Sxy$: $x$ is a child of $y$
- $Pxy$: $x$ is a parent of $y$
- $Mx$: $x$ is a mother
- $Fx$: $x$ is a father
- $d$: David
- $k$: Kit

translate the following sentences into predicate logic:

1. David is a parent of Kit and Kit is the child of David.
2. Kit is not a child of David but Kit is a father.
3. If Kit is a parent of David then either Kit is a mother or Kit is a father.
4. Every mother is a parent of someone.
5. Everyone is a child of a father.
6. There are mothers which are not fathers.
7. Every child of David is a father.
8. For every child of David, there is a parent of that child who is a mother.
9. Kit has a parent who is neither a mother nor a father.
10. Kit is a mother and if Kit has a child then that child is a father.

## Part B

Using the following symbolization key:

- $Ax$: $x$ is an animal
- $Gx$: $x$ is an alligator
- $Mx$: $x$ is a monkey
- $Rx$: $x$ is a reptile
- $Zx$: $x$ lives at the zoo
- $Lxy$: $x$ likes $y$
- $a$: Alfred
- $b$: Bertrand
- $c$: Charles

translate the following sentences into predicate logic:

1. Alfred, Bertrand and Charles live at the zoo.
2. Bertrand is a reptile, but not an alligator.
3. If Charles likes Bertrand then Bertrand is a monkey.
4. If both Bertrand and Charles are alligators, then Alfred likes them both.
5. Every animal at the zoo is either a monkey or an alligator.
6. Some reptiles live at the zoo.
7. Every alligator is a reptile.
8. There are reptiles which are not alligators.
9. Bertrand likes all monkeys that live at the zoo.
10. Every monkey that Charles likes, is also liked by Alfred.

## Part C

Using the following symbolization key:

- $Exy$: $x$ is to the east of $y$
- $Nxy$: $x$ is to the north of $y$
- $Tx$: $x$ is a town
- $Mx$: $x$ is a metropolis
- $h$: Hong Kong
- $p$: Paris
- $l$: Los Angeles
- $n$: New York
- $a$: Antarctic

translate the following formulas into English:

1. $(Nnl \& Enl)$
2. $(\sim Nhp \& \sim Epn)$
3. $\forall x(Mx \supset Nxa)$
4. $\exists x(Tx \& Nxn)$
5. $\forall x(Tx \& Exl)$
6. $\exists x(Mx \& Nnx)$
7. $\forall x(Mx \supset (Nxp \lor Epx))$
8. $\forall x(Tx \supset \forall y( Nyx \supset Eny))$
9. $\exists x(Mx \& \forall y(Ty \supset \sim Nyx))$

## Part D

- $b$: Bob
- $j$: Jim

3. $(Pb \lor Rbz)$
4. $((\sim Pb \& Rbz) \equiv Rjz)$
5. $\sim (Pj \supset Rzz)$
6. $((Pb \lor Pj) \supset (Rbj \& Rzj))$
7. $(Pj \supset (Rbb \supset Rjj))$
8. $\exists x(Px \& \exists y (Rxy))$
9. $\forall x \sim (Rxx)$
10. $\forall x (Px \supset Rxz)$
